The language files in this folder are in UTF-8 format.
Not all text editors can work with this encoding
so be careful not to overwrite the files with ANSI/ASCII formats.

_buildLanguages.cmd generates new ANSI files which use character code entities
in place of the original extended UTF chars for more reliable web serving.
The generated ANSI files will be written to the 'languages' folder beside this one.
