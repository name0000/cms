<h2>Day cream for the face Hydrate and Protect from Mileo</h2>
<p>
Recently, I have come across products that I fall in love with already from the first try. The same happened with Hydrate and Protect Day Cream for from Mileo.
</p>
<p>
I like the simple and cute style of Mileo. The bottle with the batcher, is made of qualitative plastic. Just see how lovely it is.

The product is intended for daytime use, for normal skin. 

The cream has a rather thick, delicate texture of cream color and a delicate, pleasant aroma.

The product is easily distributed over the skin and is quickly absorbed. It does not leave any sticky spots and is not felt on the skin at all.

Hydrate and Protect cream perfectly nourishes and moisturizes my skin, gives it a feeling of comfort. With it, my skin is moisturized, soft and velvety, very pleasant to the touch.

I can not fail to note that the remedy improves the complexion, makes the skin look and feel fresh.

As part of, there is an extract of violet, which stimulates the production of aquaporins proteins, these are responsible for deep moisture of the skin. And this is exactly what my skin needs.

<p>
And one more plus - the portions of the cream consumption should be small, it will suffice for a long time.

I am very pleased with this product and use it with pleasure.
